      <h1>500 - Oops</h1>

      <p>Something went wrong on our end and we couldn&apos;t fix it in time.</p>

      <p>
        As a small token of our appreciation for you, dear visitor, we offer
        this limerick in place of what you were really looking for, with the
        hope that you find solace in its literary wonder.

        <p class="poem">
          There was a Young Lady whose chin,<br />
          Resembled the point of a pin;<br />
          So she had it made sharp,<br />
          And purchased a harp,<br />
          And played several tunes with her chin.
